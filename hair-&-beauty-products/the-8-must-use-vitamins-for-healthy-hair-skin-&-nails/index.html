              <p>Each 12g serving provides 12g of collagen, sourced from grass-fed cows. It also contains 11g of protein and no carbohydrates, making it keto-friendly.</p>
              <p>This collagen powder doesn't have any flavor or sweeteners, and is incredibly versatile and easy to incorporate into smoothies and drinks.</p>

            <li><h2>Ritual Postnatal Multivitamin</h2></li>

                  <li>Vitamin E, which may help treat eczema.</li>
                  <li>Keratin, a protein that's the primary structural component of your hair, skin, and nails. However, research on the effectiveness of taking keratin as a supplement is lacking.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions about Hair, Skin, and Nail Vitamins</h2>

            <details>
              <summary>Which Vitamin is the Best for Hair Growth?</summary>
              <p>Vitamin D and iron are essential for healthy hair growth; Vitamin D supports the development of new hair follicles, while iron ensures those follicles receive adequate oxygen.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>What is the Best Supplement to Grow your Hair and Nails?</summary>
              <p>Since people have different nutritional needs and respond uniquely to supplements, the 'best' choice for hair and nail growth is not the same for everyone.</p>
              <p>Ingredients like biotin, which are often used, lack sufficient evidence to support their claims for hair and nail growth, but compounds such as omega-3 DHA, collagen, and hyaluronic acid show greater potential for effectiveness.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>Do Hair, Skin, and Nail Vitamins Help with Hair Growth?</summary>
              <p>Research suggests that ingredients like DHA omega-3s can support hair growth and health. Furthermore, a lack of key nutrients, including B vitamins, iron, and vitamins C and D, is linked to poor hair growth.</p>
              <p>The benefits of using supplements of these nutrients specifically to promote hair growth have not yet been sufficiently proven.</p>

              <summary>Do Hair, Skin, and Nail Vitamins Actually Work?</summary>
              <p>Unlike some other components, ingredients such as collagen and hyaluronic acid—frequently included in hair, skin, and nail supplements—have stronger research supporting their benefits.</p>
              <p>It's crucial to remember that the existing research on these supplements is scarce, meaning more robust studies must be conducted to confidently confirm whether hair, nail, and skin vitamins are truly effective.</p>
