  <h1>10 Skin Care Products to Never Put or Use on Your Face</h1>
    <p>Your face is more delicate than the rest of your body, and not every product is safe to apply on it. Some household or body-care items can cause irritation, breakouts, or even long-term damage.</p>
    <p>Below are ten products people commonly use on their faces but should avoid â€” along with safer alternatives.</p>

  <h1>1. Household Bleach</h1>
    <p>Bleach is extremely harsh and can cause chemical burns, irritation, and permanent damage to your skin barrier.</p>
    <p>Instead, use gentle cleansers made for the face and never apply cleaning products to your skin.</p>

  <h1>2. Toothpaste</h1>
    <p>Some people apply toothpaste to pimples, but it contains strong detergents and fluoride that can irritate or worsen acne.</p>
    <p>Use acne treatments with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid instead.</p>

  <h1>3. Body Soap and Bar Soaps</h1>
    <p>Body soaps are often too alkaline and strip away natural oils, leaving facial skin dry and irritated.</p>
    <p>Opt for mild, pH-balanced facial cleansers.</p>

  <h1>4. Hair Products</h1>
    <p>Hair gels, sprays, and oils can clog pores when they touch your skin, causing breakouts along the hairline.</p>
    <p>Keep hair products away from your face and choose non-comedogenic formulas if needed.</p>

  <h1>5. DIY Acid Treatments</h1>
    <p>Lemon juice, vinegar, and other kitchen acids are unpredictable and can burn or discolor skin.</p>
    <p>Use professionally formulated AHA or BHA products for safe exfoliation.</p>

  <h1>6. Hair Removal Creams</h1>
    <p>Depilatory creams for the body are too harsh for facial skin and can cause burns or swelling.</p>
    <p>Use products specifically designed for facial hair removal, or try threading or waxing.</p>

  <h1>7. Harsh Scrubs</h1>
    <p>Scrubs made with walnut shells, sugar, or coffee grounds can create microtears in the skin and worsen sensitivity.</p>
    <p>Gentle chemical exfoliants are a safer option for smooth skin.</p>

  <h1>8. Rubbing Alcohol</h1>
    <p>Isopropyl alcohol dries out skin, disrupts the barrier, and may cause rebound oiliness.</p>
    <p>Use alcohol-free toners or dermatologist-approved antiseptics if needed.</p>

  <h1>9. Nail Glue or Industrial Adhesives</h1>
    <p>These contain strong chemicals that can irritate or burn skin and should never be applied to the face.</p>
    <p>Only use cosmetic-grade adhesives specifically labeled for safe use near the eyes or skin.</p>

  <h1>10. Expired Cosmetics</h1>
    <p>Old makeup and skincare can harbor bacteria, lose effectiveness, and trigger breakouts or infections.</p>
    <p>Always check expiration dates and replace products regularly.</p>

  <h1>Tips to Protect Your Face</h1>
    <p>
      <li>Always patch test new skincare products</li>
      <li>Use items labeled non-comedogenic and fragrance-free</li>
      <li>Follow instructions carefully to avoid overuse</li>
      <li>Store skincare properly and replace when expired</li>
      <li>Consult a dermatologist if irritation or persistent problems occur</li>
    </p>

  <h1>Takeaway</h1>
    <p>Not everything safe for your body or home belongs on your face.</p>
    <p>Avoiding harsh or inappropriate products helps protect your skin and prevents long-term damage.</p>
    <p>Stick to gentle, face-formulated products and seek professional advice for serious concerns.</p>
