        <h1>The Origin of HIV: A Historical Overview</h1>

        <section>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the virus responsible for AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome),
            has had a profound impact on global health since its discovery in the early 1980s. But its origins trace back
            much further—deep into the forests of Central and West Africa, where it crossed into humans from non-human primates.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Zoonotic Origins: From Primates to People</h2>
          <p>
            HIV is a zoonotic virus, meaning it originated in animals before infecting humans. There are two main types of HIV:
            <strong>HIV-1</strong> and <strong>HIV-2</strong>.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>HIV-1</strong>: Originated from chimpanzees in Central Africa (SIVcpz).</li>
            <li><strong>HIV-2</strong>: Originated from sooty mangabey monkeys in West Africa (SIVsmm).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These cross-species transmissions likely occurred through hunting and consumption of bushmeat, where humans came into contact with infected blood.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>How and When Did HIV Spread Among Humans?</h2>
          <p>
            Genetic studies suggest HIV-1 crossed into humans several times, but only one strain (group M) caused the global pandemic.
            The earliest known case in humans was found in a blood sample from 1959 in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contributing factors to the spread included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Urbanization and growing populations</li>
            <li>Increased travel and trade</li>
            <li>Unsafe medical practices</li>
            <li>Social changes including increased sex work</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Discovery of HIV</h2>
          <p>
            In 1981, unusual illnesses appeared in the U.S., marking the beginning of AIDS awareness. By 1983, scientists had identified the virus.
            It was initially named LAV in France and HTLV-III in the U.S., later unified under the name HIV.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            HIV's origin shows how viruses can cross from animals to humans and spread under the right conditions.
            Understanding its history helps us prevent future pandemics and improve public health responses.
