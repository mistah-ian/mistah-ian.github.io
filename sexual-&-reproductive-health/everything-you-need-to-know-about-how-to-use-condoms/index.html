        <p>
          Condoms are one of the most widely used and effective methods for preventing sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies when used correctly. However, proper knowledge of how to use them, when to use them, and what precautions to take is essential for maximum effectiveness. This article will cover everything you need to know, including safety, types, usage, precautions, and handling unexpected situations.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-one">Is it safe to use?</h2>

        <p>
          Condoms are extremely safe when used correctly. They act as a barrier to prevent semen, vaginal fluids, and blood from passing between partners. This significantly reduces the risk of sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies. Latex condoms are the most common type, and they are effective for the majority of users. For people with latex allergies, polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms are recommended.
        </p>

        <p>
          Safety also involves proper storage and handling. Condoms should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight, as heat and friction can weaken the material. It is also important to check expiration dates and inspect the condom package for any visible damage before use. Using condoms consistently and correctly with every sexual encounter provides the best protection.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-two">Using an external (outside) condom</h2>

        <p>
          External condoms, also called male condoms, are worn on the penis during intercourse. Using them correctly is essential for preventing breakage or slippage. Before use, check the package for damage and ensure the condom is not expired. Open the package carefully to avoid tearing the condom with sharp objects like scissors or teeth.
        </p>

        <p>
          When putting on an external condom, pinch the tip to leave space for semen and roll the condom down the shaft of the erect penis. This ensures that the condom does not break and provides a barrier during ejaculation. After intercourse, hold the base of the condom while withdrawing to prevent it from slipping off. Remove it carefully, tie it off, and dispose of it in the trash. Never flush condoms down the toilet.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-three">Using an internal (inside) condom</h2>

        <p>
          Internal condoms, also called female condoms, are worn inside the vagina or anus. These condoms are typically made of polyurethane or nitrile and provide an alternative to external condoms. They are inserted before sexual activity and can be placed several hours in advance, offering more flexibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          To use an internal condom, squeeze the inner ring at the closed end and insert it into the vagina, making sure the outer ring remains outside. During intercourse, guide the penis to enter the condom rather than the vagina directly. Internal condoms can also be used for anal sex, but extra care must be taken to prevent slipping. After use, twist the outer ring to contain fluids and dispose of the condom in the trash.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-four">For oral or anal sex</h2>

        <p>
          Condoms are not only for vaginal sex. They can be used for oral and anal sexual activity to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections. For oral sex, cut the tip of an external condom and use it as a barrier over the penis. Dental dams can also be used for oral sex performed on a vulva or anus.
        </p>

        <p>
          During anal sex, condoms are highly recommended because the rectal tissue is more delicate and prone to tears, increasing the risk of STI transmission. Lubrication is especially important for anal sex to reduce friction and prevent condom breakage. Only water-based or silicone-based lubricants should be used with latex condoms, as oil-based lubricants can damage the material.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-five">Lube and spermicide</h2>

        <p>
          Lubricants enhance comfort and reduce the likelihood of condom breakage. Water-based or silicone-based lubricants are compatible with latex condoms. Oil-based lubricants, such as petroleum jelly or massage oils, should be avoided with latex condoms because they weaken the material, increasing the risk of rupture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Spermicide-coated condoms contain a chemical, usually nonoxynol-9, that helps kill sperm and reduce pregnancy risk. While they provide extra protection, spermicide does not protect against sexually transmitted infections and may cause irritation in some people. Using plain condoms with proper lubrication is generally sufficient for safe and effective use.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-six">Disposal</h2>

        <p>
          After sexual activity, proper disposal of condoms is important for hygiene and environmental reasons. Never flush condoms down the toilet, as they can cause plumbing issues. Instead, tie the condom, wrap it in tissue or paper, and dispose of it in a trash bin. This ensures that fluids are contained and reduces the risk of contact with others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Environmental concerns have led to the development of biodegradable condoms, which can be safely disposed of in the trash without harming the environment. Always follow the disposal instructions provided by the manufacturer to ensure safety and hygiene.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-seven">If the condom breaks</h2>

        <p>
          Condom breakage can happen even when used correctly. If a condom breaks during sex, it is important to take immediate action. For pregnancy prevention, emergency contraception may be considered if vaginal intercourse occurred. The sooner it is taken, the more effective it is.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, if there is a risk of sexually transmitted infections, consider consulting a healthcare provider about post-exposure prophylaxis for infections such as HIV. Early consultation ensures that preventive measures can be taken within the recommended time frames, reducing the risk of long-term complications.

        <h2 id="heading-eight">Other do's and don'ts</h2>

        <p>
          Always use a new condom for each sexual encounter, and never reuse a condom. Avoid storing condoms in wallets or pockets for long periods because friction and heat can damage them. Do not use expired condoms, and always check for visible damage before use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Communication with your partner about condom use is essential. Both partners should understand correct usage, be aware of any allergies, and know how to handle unexpected issues like breakage. Using condoms consistently every time ensures maximum protection against STIs and unplanned pregnancies.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-nine">Takeaway</h2>

        <p>
          Condoms are one of the safest and most effective methods for preventing sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies when used correctly. Understanding the different types, proper usage, lubrication, disposal, and handling breakages ensures maximum protection and peace of mind. Education and communication with sexual partners are key to successful condom use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consistent and correct use, combined with regular sexual health checkups, provides the best strategy for protecting yourself and your partners. Always choose a condom that is appropriate for your needs, and do not hesitate to seek guidance from a healthcare provider for any concerns or questions regarding safe sexual practices.

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions about using condoms</h2>

          <details>
            <summary>Can condoms completely prevent pregnancy and STIs?</summary>
            <p>
              Condoms are highly effective when used correctly and consistently, reducing the risk of pregnancy by up to 98%. They also significantly lower the risk of transmitting sexually transmitted infections, although no method is 100 percent guaranteed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using condoms consistently with each sexual encounter and combining them with other preventive measures, like regular STI testing, provides the best protection for sexual health.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What should I do if a condom slips or breaks during sex?</summary>
            <p>
              If a condom slips or breaks, stop immediately. For pregnancy prevention, consider emergency contraception as soon as possible. For STIs, consult a healthcare provider for post-exposure guidance and testing recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prompt action after breakage can reduce the risk of infection and unwanted pregnancy, so it is important to know your options and act quickly.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Can I use oil-based lubricants with condoms?</summary>
            <p>
              Oil-based lubricants should be avoided with latex condoms because they can weaken the material and cause breakage. Water-based or silicone-based lubricants are safe alternatives that reduce friction and improve comfort during intercourse.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using the right type of lubricant ensures the condom maintains its integrity, increasing safety and effectiveness during sexual activity.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Are internal condoms as effective as external condoms?</summary>
            <p>
              Internal condoms provide similar protection as external condoms when used correctly. They offer an alternative for individuals who prefer not to use external condoms and can be used for vaginal or anal sex.
            </p>
            <p>
              Correct insertion, avoiding reuse, and proper lubrication are critical for maintaining the effectiveness of internal condoms and preventing STIs and unplanned pregnancies.
