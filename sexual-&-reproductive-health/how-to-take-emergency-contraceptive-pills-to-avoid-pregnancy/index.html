        <p>
          Emergency contraceptive pills are used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. They are a safe and effective option when used correctly and within the recommended time frame. Understanding how they work and how to take them properly can greatly improve their effectiveness and reduce unnecessary anxiety.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-one">What emergency contraceptive pills are</h2>

        <p>
          Emergency contraceptive pills are medications designed to prevent pregnancy after sexual intercourse has already occurred. They work primarily by delaying or preventing ovulation, which means the ovary does not release an egg for fertilization.
        </p>

        <p>
          These pills do not terminate an existing pregnancy and are not the same as abortion pills. If implantation has already occurred, emergency contraceptive pills will not be effective. This distinction is important for both medical understanding and personal decision making.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are different types of emergency contraceptive pills, including levonorgestrel based pills and ulipristal acetate pills. Each type has specific timing and effectiveness considerations that users should be aware of before taking them.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-two">When emergency contraceptive pills should be taken</h2>

        <p>
          Timing is one of the most critical factors in determining how well emergency contraceptive pills work. Most pills are most effective when taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex, ideally within the first 24 hours.
        </p>

        <p>
          Levonorgestrel based pills are generally recommended for use within 72 hours, while ulipristal acetate pills may be effective for up to 120 hours. However, effectiveness decreases with time, so earlier use is always better.
        </p>

        <p>
          Emergency contraception should be used after situations such as condom breakage, missed birth control pills, sexual assault, or any instance where contraception was not used or failed.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-three">How to take emergency contraceptive pills correctly</h2>

        <p>
          Emergency contraceptive pills are taken orally, usually as a single dose. It is important to read the instructions provided with the medication carefully and follow them exactly as directed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pill can be taken with or without food, although taking it with food may help reduce nausea. If vomiting occurs within 2 hours of taking the pill, another dose may be required, and medical advice should be sought.
        </p>

        <p>
          Emergency contraceptive pills are not meant for regular contraception. They are designed for occasional use and should not replace a consistent birth control method.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-four">Effectiveness and factors that affect it</h2>

        <p>
          Emergency contraceptive pills can reduce the risk of pregnancy by approximately 75 - 89 percent when taken correctly and within the recommended time frame. Effectiveness depends largely on how soon the pill is taken after intercourse.
        </p>

        <p>
          Body weight, timing in the menstrual cycle, and the type of pill used may influence effectiveness. Some studies suggest reduced effectiveness in individuals with higher body weight, particularly with levonorgestrel based pills.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is also important to note that emergency contraceptive pills do not protect against sexually transmitted infections. Additional testing may be needed if there is concern about infection.

        <h2 id="heading-five">Side effects and what to expect</h2>

        <p>
          Most people tolerate emergency contraceptive pills well, but mild side effects can occur. Common effects include nausea, fatigue, headache, breast tenderness, and temporary changes in the menstrual cycle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some individuals may experience spotting or a period that comes earlier or later than expected. These changes are usually temporary and resolve on their own within one menstrual cycle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Severe side effects are rare, but persistent abdominal pain or heavy bleeding should prompt immediate medical evaluation to rule out complications such as ectopic pregnancy.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-six">What to do after taking emergency contraception</h2>

        <p>
          After taking emergency contraceptive pills, it is advisable to resume or start a reliable form of ongoing contraception. Emergency pills do not provide continued protection against future pregnancies.
        </p>

        <p>
          A pregnancy test should be taken if the next menstrual period is more than one week late. This helps confirm whether the emergency contraception was effective.
        </p>

        <p>
          If emergency contraception is needed frequently, discussing long term contraceptive options with a healthcare provider can help identify a more suitable and effective method.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading-seven">Takeaway</h2>

        <p>
          Emergency contraceptive pills are a valuable option for preventing unintended pregnancy when used correctly and promptly. Understanding how they work, when to take them, and what to expect afterward improves confidence and effectiveness.
        </p>

        <p>
          While emergency contraception is safe for most people, it should be used responsibly and as part of a broader reproductive health plan that includes regular contraception and medical guidance.

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions about Emergency Contraceptive Pills</h2>

          <details>
            <summary>Can emergency contraceptive pills cause infertility</summary>
            <p>
              Emergency contraceptive pills do not cause infertility or long term reproductive problems. They temporarily affect ovulation and do not damage the uterus or ovaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Normal fertility returns quickly after use, and many people can conceive normally in subsequent menstrual cycles.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Can emergency contraception be used more than once</summary>
            <p>
              Emergency contraceptive pills can be used more than once if needed, but they are not intended for frequent use as a primary contraceptive method.
            </p>
            <p>
              Repeated use may lead to irregular periods and is less effective than consistent contraception such as pills or implants.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do emergency contraceptive pills work during ovulation</summary>
            <p>
              Emergency contraceptive pills are less effective if ovulation has already occurred. Their primary mechanism is delaying ovulation before fertilization happens.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why taking the pill as early as possible after unprotected sex is strongly recommended.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do emergency contraceptive pills protect against infections</summary>
            <p>
              Emergency contraceptive pills do not protect against sexually transmitted infections. They only reduce the risk of pregnancy after unprotected intercourse.
            </p>
            <p>
              Testing and barrier protection should be considered if there is any concern about infection exposure.
